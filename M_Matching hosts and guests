# Problem: Find matching hosts and guests pairs in a way that they are both of the same gender and nationality.
# Output the host id and the guest id of matched pair.

# Data tables: 

airbnb_hosts
host_id:int
nationality:varchar
gender:varchar
age:int

airbnb_guests
guest_id:int
nationality:varchar
gender:varchar
age:int

Solution 

with cte as
(
select distinct 
host.host_id, 
guest.guest_id, 
      case 
      when host.nationality = guest.nationality
      and  host.gender = guest.gender 
      then 'Matched' else 'Unmatched'
      end as verify
from airbnb_hosts host 
join airbnb_guests guest 
on host.nationality = guest.nationality
) 
select host_id, guest_id 
from cte 
where verify = 'Matched'

# Output: 
host_id	  guest_id
   0 	      9
   1	      5
