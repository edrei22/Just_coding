# Problem:Find the top business categories based on the total number of reviews. 
# Output the category along with the total number of reviews. Order by total reviews in descending order.

# Solution 

SELECT value as category,
  SUM(review_count) as total_reviews
FROM yelp_business
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(categories, ';')
GROUP BY value
ORDER BY total_reviews DESC;
