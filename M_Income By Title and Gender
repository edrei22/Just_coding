# Problem : Find the average total compensation based on employee titles and gender. 
# Total compensation is calculated by adding both the salary and bonus of each employee. 
# However, not every employee receives a bonus so disregard employees without bonuses in your calculation. Employee can receive more than one bonus.
# Output the employee title, gender (i.e., sex), along with the average total compensation.

# Data tables: 

sf_employee
id:int
first_name:varchar
last_name:varchar
age:int
sex:varchar
employee_title:varchar
department:varchar
salary:int
target:int
email:varchar
city:varchar
address:varchar
manager_id:int

sf_bonus
worker_ref_id:int
bonus:int

# Solution:

select emp.employee_title, emp.sex as gender, avg (salary + sumbonus) as total_salary 
from sf_employee emp
join (select worker_ref_id, sum (bonus) as sumbonus
      from sf_bonus 
      group by worker_ref_id) as bon 
on emp.id = bon.worker_ref_id
group by emp.employee_title, emp.sex
order by gender desc

# Output:

employee_title	gender	total_salary
    Auditor     	M	       2200
     Sales	      M	       4600
