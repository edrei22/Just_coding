# Problem: Find the total number of downloads for paying and non-paying users by date. 
# Include only records where non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers.
# The output should be sorted by earliest date first and contain 3 columns date, non-paying downloads, paying downloads.

# Data tables: 

ms_user_dimension
user_id:int
acc_id:int

ms_acc_dimension
acc_id:int
paying_customer:varchar

ms_download_facts
date:datetime
user_id:int
downloads:int

# Solution 

with cte as (
    select fac.date,
            sum(case when acc.paying_customer = 'yes' then fac.downloads end ) as paying, 
            sum(case when acc.paying_customer = 'no' then fac.downloads end ) as non_paying
    from ((ms_user_dimension us
    left join ms_acc_dimension acc on us.acc_id = acc.acc_id)
    left join ms_download_facts fac on us.user_id = fac.user_id)
    group by  acc.paying_customer, fac.date,fac.downloads
)
select date, sum(non_paying) as non_paying, sum(paying) as paying
from cte 
group by date 
having sum(non_paying) > sum(paying)
order by date 

# Output 

 date	     non_paying	  paying
2020-08-16	   15	        14
2020-08-17	   45	         9
