# Problem: Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary on each of the departments. 

# Tables: 

Create table Employee 
(id int, 
name varchar (50), 
salary int, 
departmentid int) 

Insert into Employee 
Values 
(1, 'Joe', 7000, 1), 
(2, 'Jim', 9000, 1), 
(3, 'Henry',8000,2), 
(4, 'Sam', 6000, 2), 
(5, 'Max', 9000, 1)

CREATE TABLE Department (
    id INT,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Department
VALUES 
(1, 'IT'), 
(2, 'Sales');

# Solution 1 

1. Find the highest Salaries per department, asign them a ranked value using DENSE_RANK(), this functions allows to asing a rank number to each row within a 
partition, taking ties into account, and therefore returns multiple employees if they have the same highest salary in the department. 

Select department_name, name, salary
From (
Select Dep.department_name, Emp.name, Emp.salary,
Dense_rank () Over (Partition by Dep.department_name order by Emp.salary desc) as ranked_salary
From Employee Emp
Join Department  Dep
On Emp.departmentid = Dep.id 
) As Aux_tab
Where ranked_salary = 1

# Solution 2 Using a Common Table Expression

with cte as 

(Select dep.department_name, emp.name, emp.salary, 
dense_rank () over (partition by department_name order by salary desc) as ranked_salary
from [dbo].[Employee] emp
join [dbo].[Department] dep
on emp.departmentid = dep.id) 

Select * 
from cte 
where ranked_salary = 1

# Solution 3 Creating a temporary table

create table #temp_tab (
department_name varchar (50), 
name varchar (50), 
salary int, 
ranked_salary int
)

insert into #temp_tab
(Select dep.department_name, emp.name, emp.salary, 
dense_rank () over (partition by department_name order by salary desc) as ranked_salary
from [dbo].[Employee] emp
join [dbo].[Department] dep
on emp.departmentid = dep.id

select * 
from #temp_globant
where ranked_salary = 1 

# Output 
  department_name, name, salary
  IT , Jim , 9000 
  IT , Max, 9000
  Sales , Henry, 8000
