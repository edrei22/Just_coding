# Problem: Find the date with the highest total energy consumption from the Meta/Facebook data centers. 
# Output the date along with the total energy consumption across all data centers.

# Data tables: 

fb_eu_energy
date:datetime
consumption:int

fb_asia_energy
date:datetime
consumption:int

fb_na_energy
date:datetime
consumption:int

# Solution 

with cte as 
(
select * 
from fb_eu_energy 
union all 
select * 
from fb_asia_energy
union all 
select * 
from fb_na_energy
),  
total_consumption as 
(
select date, sum(consumption) as total_energy, 
dense_rank() over (order by sum(consumption) desc) as ranked_consumption
from cte 
group by date
) 
select date, total_energy
from total_consumption
where ranked_consumption = 1 

# Output 

   date	        total_energy
2020-01-06	       1250
2020-01-07	       1250
