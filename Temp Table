# The difference when you create a temp table in the sintaxis is adding this symbol # before the name of the temp_table
create table #temp_employee2 
(JobTitle varchar (50), 
EmployeesPerJob int, 
AvgAge int, 
AvgSalary int) 

# You can populate your table from another table or from a query. 

# From another table: 
Insert into #temp_employee 
Select * 
from [dbo].[EmployeeSalary]

# From a query: 
Insert into #temp_employee2 
select jobtitle, count(jobtitle), avg(age), avg(salary)
from [dbo].[EmployeeDemographics] a 
join [dbo].[EmployeeSalary] b 
on a.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID
Group by JobTitle 

select * 
from #temp_employee2

# Add the following statement if you use it in a Stored Procedurem so everytime you execute the SP the temporary table will be created. 

drop table if exists #temp_employee2
