# Problem: Find the number of apartments per nationality that are owned by people under 30 years old.
# Output the nationality along with the number of apartments.
# Sort records by the apartments count in descending order.

# Data Tables: 

airbnb_hosts
host_id:int
nationality:varchar
gender:varchar
age:int

airbnb_units
host_id:int
unit_id:varchar
unit_type:varchar
n_beds:int
n_bedrooms:int
country:varchar
city:varchar

# Solution 

select nationality, count(distinct unit.unit_id) as apartment_count 
from airbnb_hosts host 
join airbnb_units unit 
on host.host_id = unit.host_id 
where age < 30 and unit_type = 'Apartment' 
group by nationality
order by apartment_count desc 

# Output

nationality	  apartment_count
     USA	           2
