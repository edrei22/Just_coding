# Problem: Find the number of times the words 'bull' and 'bear' occur in the contents. 
# We're counting the number of times the words occur so words like 'bullish' should not be included in our count.
# Output the word 'bull' and 'bear' along with the corresponding number of occurrences.

# Data table: 

google_file_store
filename:varchar
contents:varchar

# Solution 

select 'bull' as word, 
sum(case when contents like '%[^a-zA-Z]bull[^a-zA-Z]%' then 1 else 0 end) as word_count 
from google_file_store
union 
select 'bear', 
sum(case when contents like '%[^a-zA-Z]bear[^a-zA-Z]%' then 1 else 0 end)
from google_file_store

# Output: 

word	word_count
bull	   3
bear	   2
