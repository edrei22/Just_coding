# Problem: 
# Find order details made by Jill and Eva.
# Consider the Jill and Eva as first names of customers.
# Output the order date, details and cost along with the first name.
# Order records based on the customer id in ascending order.

# Data tables: 

customers

id:int
first_name:varchar
last_name:varchar
city:varchar
address:varchar
phone_number:varchar

orders

id:int
cust_id:int
order_date:datetime
order_details:varchar
total_order_cost:int

# Solution 

select a.first_name, b.order_date, b.order_details, b.total_order_cost
From Customers a
Join Orders b 
On a.id = b.cust_id 
Where a.first_name IN ('Jill', 'Eva') 
Order by a.id

# Output 

first_name	order_date	order_details	 total_order_cost
Jill	      2019-04-19	    Suit	          150
Jill	      2019-02-01	    Coat	           25
