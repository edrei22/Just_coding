# Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW. 
# You can calculate running counts, sums, averages, and other aggregate functions between any two points you specify in the data set.

# In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the FC Utrecht when they were 
# the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?

# Solution 

select 
date, home_goal, away_goal, 
sum (home_goal) over (order by season rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as running_total, 
avg (home_goal) over (order by season rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as running_avg
from match 
where 
hometeam_id = 9908 and 
season = '2011/2012'

# Output 
date	         home_goal	      away_goal	      running_total	       running_avg
2011-10-22	       1	            4                 1	                 1.00000000000000000000
2011-11-06	       6	            4	                7	                 3.5000000000000000

# Reverse running total 

# Now let's see how FC Utrecht performs when they're the away team. 
# You'll notice that the total for the season is at the bottom of the data set you queried. 
# Depending on your results, this could be pretty long, and scrolling down is not very helpful.
# In this exercise, you will slightly modify the query from the previous exercise by sorting the data set in reverse order and calculating a backward running total 
# from the CURRENT ROW to the end of the data set (earliest record).

# Solution 

select 
date, 
home_goal, 
away_goal, 
sum(home_goal) over (order by date desc rows between current row and unbounded following) as running_total, 
avg(home_goal) over (order by date desc rows between current row and unbounded following) as running_avg 
from match 
where 
hometeam_id = 9908 and 
season = '2011/2012'

# Output 

date 	        home_goal	      away_goal	     running_total	     running_avg
2012-05-06	     1	              3	              25	               1.4705882352941176
2012-04-21	     0	              2	              24	               1.5000000000000000
