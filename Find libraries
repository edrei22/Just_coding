# Problem: 
# Find libraries who haven't provided the email address in circulation year 2016 but their notice preference definition is set to email.
# Output the library code.

# Data table: 

patron_type_code:int
patron_type_definition:varchar
total_checkouts:int
total_renewals:int
age_range:varchar
home_library_code:varchar
home_library_definition:varchar
circulation_active_month:varchar
circulation_active_year:float
notice_preference_code:varchar
notice_preference_definition:varchar
provided_email_address:bool
year_patron_registered:int
outside_of_county:bool
supervisor_district:float

# Solution 

Select distinct home_library_code
From library_usage
Where circulation_active_year = 2016 
and notice_preference_definition = 'email'
and provided_email_address = 'FALSE'

# Output 

home_library_code
