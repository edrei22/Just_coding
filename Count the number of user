# Problem: 
# Count the number of user events performed by MacBookPro users.
# Output the result along with the event name.
# Sort the result based on the event count in the descending order.

# Data table: 

playbook_events

user_id:int
occurred_at:datetime
event_type:varchar
event_name:varchar
location:varchar
device:varchar

# Solution 

Select event_name, count(event_type) as event_count
From playbook_events 
Where device = 'macbook pro'
Group by event_name 
Order by event_count desc 

# Output 

event_name	event_count
home_page	     8
